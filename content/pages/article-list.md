In this essay, we review research from the social sciences on how the public makes sense of and participates in societal decisions about science and technology. We specifically highlight the role of the media and public communication in this process, challenging the still dominant assumption that science literacy is both the problem and the solution to societal conflicts. After reviewing the cases of evolution, climate change, food biotechnology, and nanotechnology, we offer a set of detailed recommendations for improved public engagement efforts on the part of scientists and their organizations. We emphasize the need for science communication initiatives that are guided by careful formative research; that span a diversity of media platforms and audiences; and that facilitate conversations with the public that recognize, respect, and incorporate differences in knowledge, values, perspectives, and goals.

**Laursen, Sandra L., and Annette Brickley. "**[**Focusing the camera lens on the nature of science: Evidence for the effectiveness of documentary film as a broader impacts strategy**](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.5408/1.3604825)**."** ***Journal of Geoscience Education*** **59, no. 3 (2011): 126-138.**

Scientists’ involvement in education has increased in recent years due to mechanisms such as the National Science Foundation’s “broader impacts” expectations for research projects. The best investment of their effort lies in sharing their expertise on the nature and processes of science; film is one medium by which this can be done efficiently. In this article, we illustrate this approach through the development of Upward and Outward: Scientific Inquiry on the Tibetan Plateau, a 20 min educational documentary film for school science classrooms and teacher professional development. The film portrays the intellectual and human processes of science as seen through the work of an international team of scientists on an interdisciplinary geoscience research project. Evidence gathered from pre=post classroom assessment responses by 350 students in grades 6–14 indicates that students absorb a variety of messages about the intellectual and social processes of science. These ideas contrast with their prior knowledge, counter common stereotypes of science and scientists, and broaden students’ notions of the scientific method.

**Dahlstrom, Michael F. "**[**Using narratives and storytelling to communicate science with nonexpert audiences**](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1320645111)**."** ***Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*** **111, no. supplement 4 (2014): 13614-13620.**

Although storytelling often has negative connotations within science, narrative formats of communication should not be disregarded when communicating science to nonexpert audiences. Narratives offer increased comprehension, interest, and engagement. Nonexperts get most of their science information from mass media content, which is itself already biased toward narrative formats. Narratives are also intrinsically persuasive, which offers science communicators tactics for persuading otherwise resistant audiences, although such use also raises ethical considerations. Future intersections of narrative research with ongoing discussions in science communication are introduced.

**Scheufele, Dietram A. "**[**Communicating science in social settings**](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1213275110)**."** ***Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*** **110, no. supplement 3 (2013): 14040-14047.**

This essay examines the societal dynamics surrounding modern science. It first discusses a number of challenges facing any effort to communicate science in social environments: lay publics with varying levels of preparedness for fully understanding new scientific breakthroughs; the deterioration of traditional media infra- structures; and an increasingly complex set of emerging technologies that are surrounded by a host of ethical, legal, and social considerations. Based on this overview, I discuss four areas in which empirical social science helps clarify intuitive but sometimes faulty assumptions about the social-level mechanisms of science communication and outline an agenda for bench and social scientists—driven by current social-scientific research in the field of science communication—to guide more effective communication efforts at the societal level in the future.

**Varner, Johanna. "**[**Scientific outreach: toward effective public engagement with biological science**](https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/64/4/333/248218)**."** ***BioScience*** **64, no. 4 (2014): 333-340.**

Most scientists agree that interacting with the public is a worthwhile endeavor, but participation in science outreach remains fairly low among biologists. Furthermore, current practices in science outreach remain largely based on ineffective communication models that may undermine public trust and interest. I argue that, in trying to improve both participation rates and the effectiveness of science outreach, we must take a more scientific approach, and we must practice outreach with the same rigor as the science that we share with the public. Here, I describe common misconceptions that can undermine the value of science communication with the public at many scales. I then describe an evidence-based, iterative, evaluative framework for biologists at all career stages to pursue public engagement in the biological sciences. These guidelines can also inform formal outreach training for scientists, specifically in promoting dialogue and engagement.

Individuals are increasingly turning to online environments to find information about science and to follow scientific developments. It is therefore crucial for scientists and scientific institutions to consider empirical findings from research in online science communication when thinking about science in the public sphere. After providing a snapshot of the current media landscape, this paper reviews recent major research findings related to science communication in the online environment and their implications for science in the 21st century. Particular emphasis is given to the bias introduced by search engines, the nature of scientific content encountered online, and the potential impact of the Internet on audiences’ knowledge and attitudes toward science.
