### Two Older Scientific American Articles

Select **two** possible starting points for your *Scientific American* Update and post article titles on course website.

List of older *Scientific American* (and *Nature*) articles:

“Meltdown in the North” by Sturm, Perovich, & Serreze, *SA*, Oct. 2003

> “Sea ice and glaciers are melting, permafrost is thawing, tundra is yielding to shrubs—and scientists are struggling to understand how these changes will affect not just the Arctic but the entire planet.”

“Protecting against the Next Katrina” by Mark Fischetti, SA, Nov. 2005

> “Wetlands mitigate flooding, but are they too damaged in the gulf?”

“Dangers of Ocean Acidification” by Scott Doney, *SA*, March 2006

> “Much of the carbon dioxide given off from the burning of fossil fuels goes into the ocean, where it changes the acid balance of sea water.  The repercussions for marine life may be enormous.”

“Fixing the Global Nitrogen Problem” by Alan Townsend & Robert Howarth, SA, Feb. 2010

> “Humanity depends on nitrogen to fertilize croplands, but growing global use is damaging the environment and threatening human health.  How can we chart a more sustainable path?” 

“On the Termination of Species”  by W. Wayt Gibbs, *SA,* Nov. 2001

> “Ecologists’ warnings of an ongoing mass extinction are being challenged by skeptics and largely ignored by politicians.  In part that is because it is surprisingly hard to know the dimensions of the die-off, why it matters, and how it can best be stopped.”

“Spring Forward” by Daniel Grossman, *SA*, January 2004

> "As temperatures rise sooner in spring, interdependent species in many ecosystems are shifting dangerously out of sync.”

“Invasive Species: Shoot to Kill” by Emma Marris, *Nature* (news feature) Nov. 2005

> The US government has adopted a tough approach to battling harmful exotic plants: specialist strike teams. But can they prevail? Emma Marris 
> 
> finds out it’s not all black and white.

“Burning Questions” by Douglas Gantenbein, *SA*, November 2002

> “Scientists work to understand and control the plague of wildfires in the West.”

“Predicting Wildfires” by Patricia Andrews, Mark Finney, and Mark Fischetti, *SA,* Aug. 2007

> “Fires are burning more acres than ever.  Where will the next blazes ignite? Can we prevent them?  Should we?

“High Hopes for Hydrogen” by Joan Ogden, *SA*, Sept. 2006

> “Using hydrogen to fuel cars may eventually slash oil consumption and carbon emissions, but it will take some time.”

"Fueling our Transportation Future” by John B. Heywood, *SA*, Sept. 2006

> “What are the options for decreasing demand for oil and lowering greenhouse gas emissions in cars and light trucks?” 

“How Green are Green Plastics?” by Tillman Gerngross and Steven Slater, SA, Aug. 2000

> “It is now technologically possible to make plastics using green plants rather than nonrenewable fossil fuels.  But are these new plastics the environmental saviors researchers have hoped for?” 

“The False Promise of Biofuels” by David Biello, SA, Aug. 2011

> “The breakthroughs needed to replace oil with plant-based fuels are proving difficult to achieve.” 

“The Power of Renewables” by Matthew L. Wald, SA, March 2009

> “The need to tackle global climate change and energy security makes developing alternatives to fossil fuels crucial.  Here is how the stack up.”   (For your update, you should focus on one alternative.)

“Methane: A Menace Surfaces” by Katey Walter Anthony, SA, Dec. 2009

> “Arctic permafrost is already thawing, creating lakes that emit methane. the heat-trapping gas could dramatically accelerate global warming. How big is the threat? What can be done?”
