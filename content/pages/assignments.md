### Introductory Exercise

One of our key goals for this semester is to understand how to adapt our writing to the needs of a particular audience.  For this exercise and for your first essay, you should write for your fellow students—all of them.

Take some time to reflect on the physical places that have been important to you as you were growing up—places outside of your own home.  Pay particular attention to outdoor settings.  Choose one of these places and describe it as fully and precisely as you can.  If all of the places that come to mind are interiors (e.g. schools, old barns, grandparents’ homes), go ahead and write about one of them.  Initially, just devote yourself to the task of bringing this place to life for your readers.  Focus on the particular features that matter to you, but hold off on describing your feelings and explaining your perspective.  Use precise nouns and concrete adjectives; steer clear of emphatic adverbs (e.g. “extremely”) and abstract nouns (e.g. “nature”).

If all goes well, your readers will visualize this setting as it appears in your memories.  Keep in mind that your classmates do not know you well and may know nothing about the environment in which you grew up.  Provide revealing details.

- The description should be roughly 350 words long (one double-spaced page), but the length will vary depending on the nature of the setting.
- When you feel that your description is complete, start a new page and write a paragraph in which you explain why this place is important to you.

### Narrative Commentary #1

All of the autobiographical narratives assigned for today explore the relationship between place and identity.  Some look for the source of identity in the landscapes of childhood; others seek new identities in new settings.  Choose one of the three longer autobiographical narratives assigned for February 8th, and write up a brief commentary (c. 300 words) in which you explain the relationship between place and identity as you see it in this narrative.  What aspects of the setting matter to the author?  How does the setting shape them?  How does the author relate to the other inhabitants (past or present) of this distinctive setting?

Keep in mind that you will be sharing this commentary with your classmates.  Make sure that you provide them with supporting evidence and that you spell out the guiding logic.

### Narrative Commentary #2

I have assigned two pairs of narratives for this class.  Each of the narratives explores an author’s deep feelings about a particular environment. As you read each narrative (three essays and one excerpt from a longer work), try to figure out the writer’s motive.  Then, choose one of the pairs and explore the relationship between the two narrative works.  What do you see as the central idea of each work?  Do the two works written by one author express the same basic values?  How can you tell?  Why do you imagine that the author chose to explore his or her ideas in narrative form?

Choose one pair of narratives assigned for today and write up a coherent response to the above series of questions (c. 300 words).  Do not summarize the two works; delve into the deeper logic that shapes each one.  Be sure to include evidence from the two narratives.
