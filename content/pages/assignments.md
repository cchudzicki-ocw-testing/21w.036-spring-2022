### Introductory Exercise

One of our key goals for this semester is to understand how to adapt our writing to the needs of a particular audience.  For this exercise and for your first essay, you should write for your fellow students—all of them.

Take some time to reflect on the physical places that have been important to you as you were growing up—places outside of your own home.  Pay particular attention to outdoor settings.  Choose one of these places and describe it as fully and precisely as you can.  If all of the places that come to mind are interiors (e.g. schools, old barns, grandparents’ homes), go ahead and write about one of them.  Initially, just devote yourself to the task of bringing this place to life for your readers.  Focus on the particular features that matter to you, but hold off on describing your feelings and explaining your perspective.  Use precise nouns and concrete adjectives; steer clear of emphatic adverbs (e.g. “extremely”) and abstract nouns (e.g. “nature”).

If all goes well, your readers will visualize this setting as it appears in your memories.  Keep in mind that your classmates do not know you well and may know nothing about the environment in which you grew up.  Provide revealing details.

- The description should be roughly 350 words long (one double-spaced page), but the length will vary depending on the nature of the setting.
- When you feel that your description is complete, start a new page and write a paragraph in which you explain why this place is important to you.

### Narrative Commentary #1

All of the autobiographical narratives assigned for today explore the relationship between place and identity.  Some look for the source of identity in the landscapes of childhood; others seek new identities in new settings.  Choose one of the three longer autobiographical narratives assigned for February 8th, and write up a brief commentary (c. 300 words) in which you explain the relationship between place and identity as you see it in this narrative.  What aspects of the setting matter to the author?  How does the setting shape them?  How does the author relate to the other inhabitants (past or present) of this distinctive setting?

Keep in mind that you will be sharing this commentary with your classmates.  Make sure that you provide them with supporting evidence and that you spell out the guiding logic.

### Narrative Commentary #2

I have assigned two pairs of narratives for this class.  Each of the narratives explores an author’s deep feelings about a particular environment. As you read each narrative (three essays and one excerpt from a longer work), try to figure out the writer’s motive.  Then, choose one of the pairs and explore the relationship between the two narrative works.  What do you see as the central idea of each work?  Do the two works written by one author express the same basic values?  How can you tell?  Why do you imagine that the author chose to explore his or her ideas in narrative form?

Choose one pair of narratives assigned for today and write up a coherent response to the above series of questions (c. 300 words).  Do not summarize the two works; delve into the deeper logic that shapes each one.  Be sure to include evidence from the two narratives.

### Narrative Essay: Kernel and Motive

#### Preparation for Narrative Essay

Describe the kernel and motive for the narrative essay due next week.  The “kernel” is the image, event, or individual that forms the starting point or seed of your narrative essay.  The “motive” is the question or insight that you want to get at in your narrative essay.  Remember—this idea need not take the form of an argument.  A narrative essay often generates more questions than answers. You should write at least two sentences about each element, but you should feel free to write much more.  If you have any questions about how you might build upon these basic elements, feel free to include those questions in your exercise. 

#### First Version

Think about your reactions to the assigned readings.  Perhaps there is an experience in your own past that has shaped your feelings about the natural environment or about environmental science?  Or perhaps some experience set you on the path to the specific field that interests you now?  Whatever experience you choose to explore in your personal narrative, be sure to help your readers enter into the experience; do not give us a grand overview.   Make clear why it matters to you.  Don’t feel that you need to write about some dramatic, inspiring event.  There may be more to discover in an experience that left you confused or uneasy.

You may choose to write about experiences from your high school years, but you should probably steer away from the events of the past year.  (Carolyn Ross explains the challenges of writing about recent events in “Rhetoric: Writing about Personal Experience.”)  If, however, you draw a blank when presented with so much freedom, I would be happy to provide additional guidance.

Remember that most of your fellow students know little about the circumstances of your childhood and education.  Draw upon concrete details as you reconstruct the specific experience that intrigues you.  Concentrate initially on bringing your story to life.  Let us in on the thoughts and feelings of that time.  Eventually, you can explore the larger meaning of the experience, but do so with a light touch.  Do not paste a neat moral onto your story.

You may find it useful to think of yourself as a storyteller sitting with a group of MIT friends late at night, summoning up a world that these new friends can know only through you.

A successful essay cannot, however, simply record a series of events or feelings.  An essay is not a platter of mental food to be handed over to the reader.  You need to take an active role in reflecting upon your experience.  Taken literally, the term “personal narrative” can be misleading.  The essay should not sound like an overgrown journal entry.  The material that you draw upon can grow and change shape as you craft your essay.  You should develop the most revealing details and omit those that are distracting or unproductive.   Make sure that you have read Carolyn Ross’s chapter on “Writing about Personal Experience” and thought about its implications for your particular subject.

The first version of this essay should be at least 1000 words long.  The revised essay should be at least 1250 words long.  Make the first version as complete as possible.  It should not be a rough draft.  Proofread and edit your essay.

Once you have finished the first version of your essay, write a letter to your readers commenting on the state of your essay.  Let your readers know something about your plans for revision.  Point your readers to the issues that concern you.

#### Peer Review

Guidelines for comments and workshop discussions:

Begin by reading your partners’ essays for pleasure.  Then, take a look at the list of questions provided here and reread the essays with these questions in mind and write out your comments.  Use each question as the point of departure for a thoughtful response (“yes” and “no” answers are of little value to your partners). Your finished comments on each essay should add at least one and half pages (400 words) to the guideline document.

Remember that your comments are intended to help the writer create a more compelling version of his or her essay.  Be tactful and complete.  I have not asked you to comment on the writer’s grammatical or mechanical errors.  I will take care of those problems myself.  Thank you in advance for your thoughtful comments.

I will announce partner assignments just before you begin work on this peer-review assignment.  I will reorganize workshop groups throughout the semester so that you will have a chance to work with different students each time.  I will try to ensure that each of you is in the largest group only once.  

**Questions to consider in your comments on the narrative essay.**

1. **Introduction**: Do the first few paragraphs draw you into the narrative essay?  Do they point you in the right direction?  If not, can you suggest minor revisions or additions that would make the introduction more engaging and effective?
2. **Background information** (setting and context):  What kind of background information does the author provide? Do we know enough to appreciate the narrative?  Suggestions for additions or changes?
3. **Use of detail**:  Does the author provide sufficient detail?  Which details seem particularly revealing?  Can you visualize the setting and the actions?
4. **Link between narrator and reader**: Does the writer draw you into his or her own perspective?  What kinds of small changes would help you enter into the writer’s experience?
5. **Continuity and coherence**: Are there significant gaps in the narrative?  Do you want more information or description?  Does any of the material within the narrative seem extraneous?
6. **Central insight**:  Does the essay lead up to a central insight?  How would you characterize the main idea or focal point of this essay?
7. **Balancing narration and reflection**: Does the author achieve a natural balance between narration and reflection?  (Does the author miss out on opportunities to reflect on the story?  Does the story have a life of its own or is it merely a prelude to the author’s conclusions? )
8. **Conclusion**: Does the essay come to a natural end?  Does it invite you to draw some conclusions about the writer’s experience?  Can you see the connection between the starting point and the ending point of this essay?  Suggestions?
9. **Generalizations**:  Does the author present conclusions that reach beyond the scope of the narrative?  Identify any unwarranted generalizations.  How might the writer get at these insights without generalizing?
10. **Major strengths**: What do you see as the major strengths of this essay?
11. **Opportunities for revision**: What aspects of the essay should be reconsidered or revised?  Where does it need attention? (If you have already covered #10 in your responses to earlier questions, you may skip it.)

#### Revised Version

See instructions for the first version of the essay. The revised essay should be at least 1250 words long.

### Critical Review

#### Pre-draft exercise #1

1. Identify the pair of documentaries that you plan to examine in your critical review.
2. Provide full identifying information for each documentary.
    1. Director(s) \[If no director, look for other decision-maker.\]
    2. Organization that originally sponsored/commissioned the production (e.g. British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), Public Broadcasting System (PBS), National Geographic, Discovery Channel, etc.)
    3. Original production date
    4. \[If relevant\] Narrator/Host
3. List two or three initial observations about the different strategies adopted by the directors/producers of your documentaries.

**Preparation/Advice for first phase of critical review assignment:**

- Rationale for pre-draft exercise #1:
    - Director’s name—the decision maker (should play an active & explicit role in your discussion). Find out info on director et al.
    - Narrator—the main character in some documentaries.
    - Original sponsoring organization and original venue (TV, website, movie theatre, etc.)—key to understanding audience & objective.
    - Dates—relation between the documentaries & evolving science
- Some basic guidelines for Critical Review (Version 1 due on March 10th):
    - Length—what this means for the level of detail and depth of paper
        - First Version must be at least 1500 words long.
        - Revised version must be between 1700 and 2000 words long.
    - Active voice: Real people made decisions and created the documentary
    - You are your readers’ guide. Spell out your reasoning.
    - Evidence—Make sure we know where it comes from.
        - Use MLA citation system (more later)
    - No draft is complete without Works Cited list!
    - Write a letter to your workshop partners

#### Pre-draft Exercise #2

1. Identify the article or articles that provide background information on the topic that provides a focus for the documentaries you plan to analyze. (You are in charge of finding these articles, but I am happy to help.)
    - Describe briefly what kind of information it provides.
2. Identify the article or articles on documentaries that you plan to use in the course of your critical review. (You should choose among the articles described as broader articles on science documentaries.  Do not include the Diego Pineda article.)
    - Describe briefly what role the article or articles might play in your critical review. What perspective does the article provide?
    - (You may choose a different article later if your own ideas change, but do your best to select an article or articles that will help you develop your ideas.)

#### Pre-draft Exercise #3 

Briefly describe central idea for your critical review (½ page); then, create a tentative outline for your critical review.  The outline should highlight the development of your central idea, not just the sequence of topics. Come to class prepared to discuss your outline.

#### Critical Review First Version

Scientific researchers whose findings have direct implications for ordinary citizens are often stymied by the challenges involved in bringing their findings to the general public.  One traditional strategy has been to rely on magazines like *Scientific American*, the *New Yorker*, and *Discover* or newspapers like the *New York Times*.  But what about the many ordinary people who do not read these publications or who simply skim the science articles because the vocabulary seems daunting?  Are there other strategies that might reach a broader or simply a different audience?  What about the web?  What about the television networks?  What about more personal outreach?

Imagine that several U.S. foundations have joined forces to fund the new Green Media Institute.  The Institute will be devoted to educating the general public about the environment and environmental issues.  Its primary task will be to distribute grants to worthy media ventures.  Before they can open the application process, however, the institute’s staff feels that they need to learn more about some of the media that applicants are likely to select.  They have turned to several journalists and critics for help in understanding the distinctive strengths and limitations of various media.

You have been asked to focus on video documentaries (as opposed to audio documentaries and podcasts). You want to build a solid foundation for your commentary, so you have chosen to develop your broader insights into video documentary through a careful critical review of two particular documentaries.

\*\*\*

To achieve the desired goal of providing broad insights into video documentary as a potentially enlightening educational medium, you must take on the unfamiliar task of analyzing and reviewing two specific documentary productions.  The only roughly comparable assignment that most of you have completed is a book review.  In this case, however, you need to educate yourself before you can write your review.  You will also need to expand the range of features that you consider in your review to include sounds and sights as well as words.  I have put together a list of documentaries that focus on four topics of interest to environmental scientists.  All of these documentaries were designed with the intention of engaging and edifying the general public.  While these materials were originally presented in many different venues, you can now view all of them on the web.  Pick a couple of topics that intrigue you; then, watch ten minutes or so of the videos associated with those topics before you choose the pair of documentaries that you wish to view in their entirety several times.

            Each of the listed documentaries attempts to bridge the distance between the work of academic scientists and the interests and priorities of the lay public.  The directors and producers have chosen different strategies, in part because they bring distinctive priorities to their task and in part because they make different assumptions about their audiences.  As you review the documentaries, try to uncover the producers’ priorities and their assumptions about the audience.  In other words, what are they trying to accomplish and why have they chosen their particular strategy?  What happens to the scientific studies as they are translated into a more accessible format? To what extent do the documentaries consider the social and political context for environmental issues?

            Remember your intended audience and your intended goal.  Keep in mind that the folks at the Green Media Institute may not have seen either of the video documentaries that you plan to examine.

**First Version of Critical Review due on Thursday, March 10th:**

- 1st version must be at least 1500 words long. Include MLA works cited list.
- Proofread and edit your critical review; then, write a letter addressed to your workshop partners commenting on the state of your critical review.
- Post your critical review and letter by 1pm. Post your critical review as a Word document (not a pdf or pages doc).
- Bring three copies of your critical review and letter to class.

#### Peer Review #2: Critical Review

Guidelines for comments and workshop discussions of Critical Review

Begin by reading your partners’ critical reviews for pleasure.  Then, take a look at the list of questions provided on the next page and reread the reviews with these questions in mind.  Write out your comments on your partners’ critical reviews (see list below).  Use each question as the point of departure for a thoughtful response (“yes” and “no” answers are of little value to your partners).  Your finished comments on each critical review should be at least 400 words long (not counting the questions themselves).  When you are satisfied with what you have written, post your comments (by 1pm) in the appropriate location for each of your partners.  Be sure to include your name and the name of the essay’s author with your comments.

Remember that your comments are intended to help the writer create a more compelling version of his or her critical review.  Be tactful and complete.  I have not asked you to comment on the writer’s grammatical or mechanical errors.  I will take care of those problems myself.  Thank you in advance for your thoughtful comments.

**Questions for the Critical Review**

SPECIFICS:

1. How effective is the current introduction? Does it engage your interest? Does it establish a clear direction for the ensuing discussion? Any suggestions for the author?
2. Does the writer make clear why his or her subject matters?
3. What is the main idea (central insight) of the critical review? Where do you see that idea stated most clearly?
4. Does the writer provide sufficient background information about the subject of the documentaries, or is there something more that you would like to know? Does the background information appear in the most useful location within the critical review?
5. Did you learn enough about the documentaries to enable you to follow the writer’s analysis?
6. Does the writer make effective use of one or more of the scholarly articles on science documentaries? If not, can you suggest a possible role for one of the articles?
7. How well does the writer handle evidence from the video and the journal articles? Is there enough supporting evidence within each paragraph? If not, point out weak spots.
8. Can you follow the logic that leads from one paragraph to the next? Identify any gaps—places where you have difficulty following the logic.
9. How effective is the writer’s conclusion? What changes or additions might you suggest?
10. Reconsider the introduction in the light of the conclusion. Does the introduction point the reader in the right direction?  Would you suggest any changes to the introduction?

OVERVIEW:

1. What is the most intriguing point presented in this review?
2. What would you say are the review’s major strengths and why?
3. Should the writer consider reorganizing the critical review? Does the sequence of points within the review lead us step by step toward the central insight?
4. What do you think the writer needs to focus on when he or she begins revising this critical review?
5. Does the writer’s prose serve him or her well? Do you have any general suggestions for next version?
6. Review author’s letter to workshop partners. If the writer asked for your input on a particular question, please answer that question here.

Reminders for next version:

1. Identify your writers and directors (or producers) in the body of your critical review and include any relevant background information.
2. Use the MLA in-text citation system. You can find information on this citation system on the web (check out the Purdue OWL site).
3. Remember to include a list of “Works Cited” at the end of your essay. Without such a list, your readers have no way of locating the sources that you mention in your essay.  **The absence of a Works Cited list will result in an automatic grade penalty.**   
    Documentaries, articles, and websites should all appear in your list of works cited.
